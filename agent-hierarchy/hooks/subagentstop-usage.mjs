/**
 * agent-hierarchy — usage collector, fired on SubagentStop.
 *
 * When a subagent finishes, this reads its transcript from disk, sums the
 * per-turn `message.usage` token counts, and appends ONE line to USAGE_FILE.
 * That is the entire mechanism: a node process reading local files. It costs
 * zero tokens — no model is involved, and no agent is ever asked to report its
 * own usage.
 *
 * The join that makes attribution work: the transcript itself does not say
 * which agent type it belongs to (only a display slug), while the hook payload
 * carries `agent_type` but no token counts. This event is where both are in
 * hand at once. The record stores the RAW agent_type; mapping to a hierarchy
 * role happens at report time, so the mapping can change without touching data.
 *
 * Path derivation, verified against the real layout:
 *   payload.transcript_path = <project_dir>/<session_id>.jsonl   (the parent's)
 *   subagent transcript     = <project_dir>/<session_id>/subagents/agent-<agent_id>.jsonl
 *
 * `found:false` records are deliberate telemetry, not noise: the SubagentStop
 * payload shape is assumed to mirror SubagentStart's (proven), and if a harness
 * change ever breaks the derivation, a run of found:false lines is the only
 * way anyone notices — this channel has no user-visible failure mode.
 *
 * Collects whenever the plugin's hooks are loaded, independent of the
 * /hierarchy on-off flag: that flag governs the orchestration directive, and
 * usage data is exactly what you want while evaluating whether the hierarchy
 * is earning its keep. Never blocks, never throws — a broken collector must
 * not interfere with a finishing subagent.
