/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PreToolUse conduit gate (spec 0028 §3): the Orchestrator
 * is the only hierarchy role that talks to the user. Denies AskUserQuestion,
 * ExitPlanMode, SendUserFile, and PushNotification for any hierarchy role
 * (architect / implementor / reviewer / ultra-advisor / task-runner) — but
 * only on POSITIVE DIRECT ATTRIBUTION (§3.7): an unidentified caller, or one
 * known only through the persisted session-role fallback, is always allowed.
 * A false deny wedges a session with no way to proceed or explain itself; a
 * false allow just reproduces today's behaviour — the same fail-open
 * direction every other gate here takes.
 *
 * No one-shot state: this gate is not offering a choice to remember, it is
 * closing a channel — it fires every time and is never wired into
 * readGateState/setDecision.
