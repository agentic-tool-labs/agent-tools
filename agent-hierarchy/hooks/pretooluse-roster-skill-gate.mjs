/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PreToolUse gate: the mutating roster CLI verbs must go
 * through the `ah:agent-team` skill at least once per session (spec 0042
 * §1.3). Keyed on the parsed Bash command since 0048 §2.4.3 — the ah CLIs
 * are invoked through the Bash tool and the MCP tool names are gone. The
 * gated verb set lives here alone and tests/check-gate-name-agreement.mjs
 * asserts it against hooks.json's matcher.
 *
 * Gated verbs: create, adopt, move, dismiss, disband, untrack — the
 * team-side lifecycle verbs. NOT gated: the single-member
 * spawn verbs (spawn-one, spawn-ad-hoc — one role-specified member is a
 * direct call whose safety checks live in the CLI itself), the read-only
 * verbs (show, teams, history, reap, resync, layout-splits), the
 * roster-TEMPLATE CRUD verbs, and layout / alias (only ever
 * called internally by the skill's own flow) are deliberately NOT in this
 * set. Nor is anything in msg.mjs.
 *
 * One-shot per session, recorded at DENY time: the immediate identical
 * retry always proceeds, whether or not the skill was actually consulted.
 * This gate's job is to make the skill unmissable once, not to police
 * compliance — a gate re-enterable indefinitely would deadlock a session
 * where the skill genuinely does not apply. Its `deny` outranks
 * pretooluse-ah-cli.mjs's `allow` (documented precedence, 0048 §2.4.4).
 *
 * No subagent context: only an orchestrator session stands up Teams. Fails
 * OPEN (allow) on any parse/state-read error — the opposite of the
 * disband-close gate's fail-closed choice, because that gate guards an
 * irreversible destructive act and this one guards a procedural miss; a
 * crashing hook must never make roster operations unusable.
