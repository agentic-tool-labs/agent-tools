/**
 * agent-hierarchy — Stop hook: Orchestrator-side liveness check-in (spec 0028
 * §5). A Stop hook that refuses to let the Orchestrator go quiet while it is
 * still owed a report from a peer it dispatched.
 *
 * "Is this the Orchestrator" is resolved the same way `pretooluse-route-gate.mjs`
 * already does (and the same direction `pretooluse-*-gate.mjs` now do via
 * `resolveHierarchyRole`, §3.2): a caller positively attributed as a
 * SUBORDINATE hierarchy role is definitely not the Orchestrator and is
 * skipped; everything else (no attribution at all — the common case for a
 * plain top-level session) proceeds, on the same fail-open-toward-enforcement
 * direction used throughout this plugin.
 *
 * §5.3 (r4, finding 3): outstanding dispatches are this session's own
 * `type:"dispatch"` records (lib-peer.mjs, written by
 * posttooluse-peer-resolve.mjs the moment this session sends a request
 * token) cross-referenced against the messages directory — NOT the
 * peer-pending obligation store, which is keyed on the RECIPIENT's
 * session_id and so cannot answer "did THIS session dispatch this", and
 * would miss a peer that died before ever receiving the brief.
 *
 * §5.5: mutually exclusive with `stop-peer-nudge.mjs` by role — a session
 * that itself OWES a report takes precedence over one that is OWED one;
 * this hook cedes whenever the session has ANY pending peer obligation,
 * regardless of turn-marker state. An armed-marker precondition check was
 * tried first and rejected as order-dependent on hooks.json's array order,
 * which nothing here can rely on holding. Ceding on `pendingFor().length > 0`
 * alone has no such dependency: it is a superset of the cases where peer-nudge
 * would actually block, and this hook staying silent on the rest costs
 * nothing.
