/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PreToolUse route gate: who may dispatch an ah role, and how + tier rule.
 *
 * Role sessions and subagents (Agent/Task, and SendMessage peer briefs): a subordinate role
 * session (its own `up` row carries a role other than orchestrator) or any subagent (hook input
 * with `agent_id`) never dispatches a peer-eligible ah role — an Agent/Task spawn of one, or a
 * sentinel-bearing SendMessage brief to one, is DENIED EVERY TIME with route-back text: the need
 * goes back to the Orchestrator as NEEDS-<ROLE> / NEEDS-EVIDENCE. Legwork (`ah:task-runner`,
 * `task-gopher:*`), non-ah agent types, replies, and every other subagent tool call pass
 * untouched. A session whose own identity cannot be resolved (no session_id) is treated as the
 * Orchestrator: `__nosession__` never matches sessionstart.mjs's `session_id: null` row, so
 * `upRecordFor` finds nothing and `selfRole` is null — the safe direction.
 *
 * `ah:orchestrator` as a subagent: denied for every caller. The Orchestrator is the top-level
 * session. A bare `orchestrator` agent ref is not ours and passes.
 *
 * Orchestrator, Agent/Task spawning a chain role: a chain role runs only as a peer, so this is a
 * wall, denied every time, and the reason is the whole instruction:
 *   - a live instance exists → SendMessage it (free ones first) with this brief;
 *   - none live, the role has a roster member → the exact `spawn-one` command;
 *   - none live, no roster member for the role → the exact `spawn-ad-hoc` command.
 * Legwork roles pass: they are the only roles that run as subagents. The hook never spawns:
 * launching panes from here would sidestep the session's own Bash permission prompts and race
 * the hook timeout.
 *
 * Orchestrator, SendMessage peer brief: passes the route gate. The brief's role resolves from
 * team records first (all teams, then the team file its request names), then config peer
 * targets, then the roster, then the name's role token.
 *
 * Orchestrator, any SendMessage, brief or not: a `to` with no `[ref]` that equals the name a
 * member of the session's own team was renamed away from (`renamed_from`) is DENIED, naming the
 * member's real name: another session holds that name. A name one of the team's records holds
 * is never denied.
 *
 * Any SendMessage whose `to` is a recorded non-claude pane member is DENIED with that member's
 * `roster.mjs deliver` command: SendMessage cannot reach it, and a Claude session that happens to
 * hold the same name must not receive its brief.
 *
 * Tier gate (Agent/Task, and SendMessage peer briefs carrying the sentinel +
 * `[hierarchy-msg`): when the session model is known, the target is architect
 * or ultra-advisor, that role's tier ≤ the session tier, and the request file
 * carries no `reason:` — DENIED ONCE per (session, role) with
 * `{type:"tier-deny", session_id, role}`. Second attempt passes. With
 * `msgs:"off"` there is no request file to carry `reason:`, so the denial
 * text drops the `reason:` instruction.
 *
 * Fails open on an internal error, except that a dispatch of a built-in chain ref is denied: the
 * gate could not check it. Runs after the ultra approval gate and the msg gate, which are
 * independent.
