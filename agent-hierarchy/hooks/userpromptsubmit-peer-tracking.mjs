/**
 * agent-hierarchy — UserPromptSubmit tracker for the peer report-back contract.
 *
 * E2 (live-verified): UserPromptSubmit fires in the receiving session for a
 * SendMessage-delivered peer message, and the payload's `prompt` field carries
 * the full delivered text INCLUDING the `<cross-session-message>` wrapper —
 * there is no structured field that marks a delivery as a peer tasking, so
 * regexing `prompt` for the sentinel is the only and the correct mechanism.
 *
 * When the prompt carries a well-formed `[hierarchy-peer-brief reply-to="..."
 * task="..."]` sentinel inside its wrapper, this appends a "pending" record so
 * the Stop hook can hold the session to its report-back obligation. No
 * sentinel (the overwhelming majority of prompts) costs one failed regex test
 * and nothing else. Never blocks or alters the prompt — this hook only
 * observes and records; it exits silently either way. A brief that also
 * carries `[hierarchy-msg <request path>]` records that path as `msg` on the
 * obligation, which then resolves only against a reply carrying the matching
 * response pointer (see posttooluse-peer-resolve.mjs).
 *
 * Amendment 2 (interactive peers): a peer session doubles as an interactive
 * one, and enforcement must fire only on turns the PEER's own tasking work
 * touches, never on a turn the USER is driving. So, in addition to the brief
 * detection above, this arms a `{"type":"turn","status":"armed"}` marker
 * whenever BOTH: the prompt carries a `<cross-session-message>` wrapper at
 * all (ANY peer delivery — a brief, a ping, an unrelated peer message; this
 * check is intentionally unanchored, unlike the brief sentinel above), AND
 * the session has at least one pending obligation afterward — read via
 * `pendingFor` AFTER the append above, so it also catches an obligation this
 * very prompt just created. A typed prompt, or a session with no pending
 * obligations, arms nothing, which is what keeps state growth bounded to
 * active-obligation windows.
 *
 * No-ops for subagents (same `agent_id` discriminator as the rest of the
 * plugin) — a subagent is not a peer, and its own SessionStart injection is
 * already suppressed for the same reason.
 *
 * Team-intent nudge (spec 0042 §1.5): a prompt matching one of the
 * team-lifecycle phrases from `skills/agent-team/SKILL.md`'s frontmatter
 * `description` gets exactly one injected line naming the `ah:agent-team`
 * skill — read from that file at hook time so the phrase list has one
 * source of truth (the test asserts the two match). No new prompt, no
 * instruction, no restating the protocol; a prompt with no match injects
 * nothing.
