 *   roster.mjs doctor [--cwd <path>] [--check]
 *                       Read-only self-check: one JSON object, one row per thing that can be
 *                       wrong. `--check` exits 1 when any row is red. Writes nothing, ever.
 *                       (spec 0036 §3.3: re-registers the current session with its current cwd;

 *                       Resolves the session pid the same way as create --commit/teams — process.ppid
 *                       is the transient Bash-tool shell, never the session, at this call site.)
 *   roster.mjs deliver <name> --req <abs request path> [--ping <n>] [--wait-only] [--timeout <s>]
 *                       [--team <T>] [--cwd <path>]
 *                       Briefs a non-claude pane member through Herdr and waits for its turn to end;
 *                       its report comes back only as the response file beside the request.
 *   roster.mjs answer  <name> --prompt <blocked_by> --choice <id> --screen-hash <hash> [--team <T>]
 *                       [--cwd <path>]
 *                       Sends the answer the user chose to a prompt a non-claude member stopped at:
 *                       only that row's keys from the kind's table, and only while that screen is up.
 *   roster.mjs tier    set <kind> <model> <haiku|sonnet|opus|fable> | remove <kind> <model> | list
 *                       How a non-Claude model compares with Claude's tiers; global config only.
 *
 * Spec 0044: the roster is a read-only TEMPLATE for the whole team lifecycle. `init`/`add`/`edit`/
 * `remove`/`layout`/`alias` write roster level files and spawn nothing; every other command writes
 * only a team file. A session that owns a live team is refused a roster edit (§1.3) unless the USER
 * passes `--allow-roster-edit` — no code path may supply that flag on the user's behalf. A team with
 * no `--team` lives at `teams/<effective-prefix>.json`, not the shared `team.json`; an existing
 * `team.json` keeps being used, unmigrated, until its own team disbands (§1.7).
 *
 * `--team <name>` (spec 0011 §5.1) selects a named team's `teams/<name>.json`
 * in place of the default `team.json`, on every subcommand above that touches
 * a team file; omitted, everything resolves the default team exactly as
 * before. `create --team <T>` (§5.2) writes `teams/<T>.json`.
 *
 * `--level`/the positional bare word are equivalent; `add`/`edit`/`remove`
 * with neither default to the level the roster currently resolves from
 * (repo-user > repo > global) and print which level they chose.
 *
 * `create` is two-phase, both file-I/O-only: `--plan` (default) resolves the
 * roster, refuses a live Team, clears a stale one, and reports the transport
 * plus each member's derived name and spawn shape — it spawns nothing.
 * `--commit` persists a Team the caller (the SKILL.md flow) has already
 * spawned and verified via ListAgents, writing team.json.
 *
 * `resync` re-derives every peer member's herdr location from herdr's own live
 * topology and rewrites team.json; `move` executes a `herdr pane move` then
 * resyncs that one member. Bare `disband`/`--plan` also resyncs first, in
 * memory only (no write) — see docs/specs/0008-roster-relocate.md.
