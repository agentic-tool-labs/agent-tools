/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PreToolUse gate on Ultra-Advisor escalation.
 *
 * The Ultra-Advisor is the escalation apex and the most expensive tier in the
 * hierarchy, so it does not run on the Orchestrator's say-so alone. The first
 * dispatch attempt in a session is DENIED with instructions telling the
 * Orchestrator to put the decision to the user and record the answer; later
 * dispatches follow whatever the user chose.
 *
 * Denying and having the model ask (rather than returning "ask" outright) is
 * what buys the three-way choice: the native permission dialog offers only
 * allow/deny, and "ask me each time" has to be one of the answers.
 *
 * Inert unless the dispatch is an Ultra-Advisor dispatch and the hierarchy is
 * enabled — every other tool call passes through untouched.
 *
 * Covers TWO routes to the same role, so neither can bypass the gate: an
 * Agent/Task dispatch matched by subagent_type, and a SendMessage matched by
 * its `to` target naming the Ultra-Advisor's peer session — normally the
 * "<repo>-ultra-advisor" convention, but a role's `peer` config value can
 * name any session explicitly — or several (see `resolvedPeerTargets` in
 * lib-config.mjs; any of them is gated),
 * so a SendMessage that misses the convention-name fast path falls through
 * to a config read before being cleared. Another instance of the role, a
 * second one or one renamed because another session held the plain name,
 * is gated too: by the `<prefix>-<role>-<n>` pattern on every gated
 * prefix, which needs no team file, and by its recorded name in a team
 * whose prefix is gated. A SendMessage to any other peer —
 * including a peer for a different hierarchy role — passes through
 * untouched.
 *
 * A Bash call is a third route, into an Ultra-Advisor running in a Herdr pane:
 * `roster.mjs deliver` to one gets the same decision as a SendMessage (its
 * `--wait-only`, and a ping for a request already delivered, send no new
 * task). A `deliver` command the parser cannot read gets that decision, with
 * no exemption, when any of its words names an Ultra-Advisor. A raw Herdr
 * input verb aimed at one, by name or pane id, is always denied, except a
 * `send-keys` of exactly one key token. Every other Bash call is passed on
 * one string test, before any config is read. `roster.mjs` refuses a
 * `deliver` to an advise-class member itself when no approval is recorded,
 * for the shell shapes this hook cannot see.
