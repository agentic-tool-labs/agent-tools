/**
 * agent-hierarchy — SessionStart context injection.
 *
 * Injects the resolved role→model table plus the orchestration protocol, so a
 * fresh, resumed, forked, or post-compaction session starts already knowing
 * which model each role runs on and how to route work through the chain.
 *
 * Gating, in this order:
 *   - Subagent (`agent_id` set) → inject NOTHING. `ah:*` role
 *     agents must never receive the protocol, since subagents can nest and an
 *     Implementor that starts orchestrating defeats the hierarchy; foreign
 *     subagents such as `task-gopher:task-gopher` should not pay for it
 *     either. Each role agent gets its own instructions from its `agents/*.md`
 *     body, which IS loaded at spawn. Unlike sibling plugins that must relay
 *     their directives into subagents to work at all (see
 *     docs/subagent-directive-relay.md), suppression is the INTENT here. A
 *     soft role-gate sentence stays in the directive as a backstop for paths
 *     where the hook does not run.
 *   - Top-level `--agent <hierarchy role>` (`agent_type` set, `agent_id` not)
 *     → the role-session notice, and an `up` record in the peer roster
 *     (the session's pid is `process.ppid` — verified: every hook's parent is
 *     the claude process, also exposed as env CLAUDE_PID). It is a main
 *     session, so the directive would otherwise reach it, but it is NOT the
 *     Orchestrator. A top-level `--agent` session running a non-hierarchy
 *     agent deliberately falls through: it is a legitimate main session that
 *     may orchestrate.
 *   - Top-level, configured, enabled  → the directive + HIERARCHY STATE block
 *     (open exchanges, peer roster, tier line) on every matcher including
 *     compact; on `startup` a silent sweep of closed exchanges runs first.
 *   - Top-level, no usable config     → a one-line setup nudge.
 *   - Top-level, config with enabled:false → silence (the user opted out;
 *     nudging them to configure would be wrong).
 *
 * There is exactly ONE write to stdout in this file, at the very end. Two JSON
 * objects on stdout is malformed output, and the harness drops the injection
 * without saying so — so build the string first, then write it once.
