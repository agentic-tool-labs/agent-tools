/**
 * agent-hierarchy — Stop hook for the peer report-back contract.
 *
 * If this session has unresolved peer obligations (a sentinel arrived via
 * UserPromptSubmit tracking and no matching SendMessage reply was seen),
 * block the stop and name what is owed. E3 (live-verified): a Stop hook's
 * {"decision":"block","reason":...} re-prompts the model with the reason, and
 * the immediately following Stop payload carries `stop_hook_active: true` —
 * the UI renders the reason under a "Stop hook error:" label, so the wording
 * below is written to read sensibly there.
 *
 * Loop guards, all mandatory — this must never trap a session:
 *   - On a PEER-DRIVEN (armed) turn, each (session, task, from) obligation is
 *     blocked at most MAX_NUDGES times (tracked via an incrementing `nudges`
 *     field re-appended on the pending record); once exhausted it is marked
 *     "waived" and the stop is allowed even though nothing was ever sent.
 *     `stop_hook_active` deliberately does NOT short-circuit this path — the
 *     ceiling is what guarantees termination, and a blanket allow on the
 *     re-stop made that ceiling unreachable (see below).
 *   - On a USER-DRIVEN (unarmed) turn, `stop_hook_active: true` allows, which
 *     bounds the reminder to one block per turn.
 *   - Any read/parse failure anywhere in this hook allows the stop.
 *   - While this session has background work in flight (`hasInflightSubagent`,
 *     recorded by subagent-inflight.mjs for background subagents, background
 *     Bash, Monitor), the stop is allowed silently, armed
 *     or not and whatever `stop_hook_active` says: no nudge is spent, nothing
 *     is waived, the marker is untouched. A peer dispatching background work
 *     and ending its turn is waiting, not finished. This defers the check
 *     rather than cancelling it — each background subagent's completion
 *     re-invokes this session, and that turn's own stop runs the branches
 *     below with the budget intact. An orphaned `started` record (its
 *     SubagentStop never fired) defers at most SUBAGENT_INFLIGHT_TTL_MS.
 *
 * Why `stop_hook_active` is not a blanket allow: a block re-prompts the model,
 * and a model that answers the re-prompt by WRITING its response file without
 * SendMessage-ing it then stops again — that second stop carries
 * `stop_hook_active: true`. Allowing it unconditionally spent the whole
 * enforcement budget on one block, left the obligation `pending` on disk, and
 * nothing re-armed it, because re-arming requires another inbound
 * cross-session delivery that a one-shot tasking never gets. That is a live
 * failure mode, not a hypothetical: an Implementor wrote its report, echoed
 * the `[hierarchy-msg ...]` token in its own output, and went idle, stranding
 * the orchestrator until a human asked it directly.
 *
 * Amendment 2 (interactive peers), as amended: the turn marker (armed by
 * UserPromptSubmit tracking on a peer-delivered turn) no longer decides
 * WHETHER to enforce, only whether enforcing costs budget. A report is owed
 * regardless of who drove the turn, so an unarmed turn still blocks; it just
 * does not consume a nudge, which preserves the original point of the
 * exemption — unrelated user chat must not burn the budget or pressure a
 * premature reply. The marker is no longer consumed by the act of blocking
 * either: it is released only when the obligation is waived here (or resolved
 * by posttooluse-peer-resolve.mjs), since spending it on a single nudge was
 * the other half of the strand above.
 *
 * The sanctioned escape, when the user genuinely does not want the report
 * sent, is to send the orchestrator a one-line "cancelled by user" reply —
 * which resolves the obligation through the normal path. Going silent is not
 * an escape: the orchestrator is stranded either way, and only the reply tells
 * it so.
 *
 * No-ops (allows) for subagents (same `agent_id` discriminator as the rest of
 * the plugin) — a subagent's report is structural, not something this
 * contract governs.
