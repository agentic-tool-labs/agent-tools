/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PostToolUse resolver for the peer report-back contract.
 *
 * Fires on every SendMessage in the peer session. When the `to` target
 * satisfies a pending peer obligation for this session — it matches the
 * recorded delivery envelope's `from`, its `from_name`, or (for an explicit
 * third-party reply-to) the `reply_to` name itself, each compared the way
 * `isGatedPeerTarget` does (stripping a trailing " [ref]") — that obligation
 * is marked resolved. A single reply can resolve more than one pending
 * obligation if more than one owed report shares the same reply target; there
 * is nothing in a SendMessage call that says which task it answers, so this
 * resolves everything the target matches rather than guessing at one. An
 * obligation recorded with `msg` (the brief carried a message-file pointer)
 * additionally requires the reply to carry `[hierarchy-msg <path>--response.md]`
 * for that id, with the file present; otherwise it stays pending.
 *
 * No-ops for subagents (same `agent_id` discriminator as the rest of the
 * plugin — a subagent is not a peer) and for anything that is not a
 * SendMessage (the hooks.json matcher already narrows to SendMessage; this is
 * the same defensive re-check pretooluse-ultra-gate.mjs makes on tool_name).
 *
 * Also records this session's own outstanding peer-route dispatches (spec
 * 0028 §5.3): any SendMessage carrying a `[hierarchy-msg <path>--request.md]`
 * token is one, recorded under THIS (the sender's) session_id regardless of
 * whether the recipient ever receives or acknowledges it — see
 * `appendDispatchRecord` in lib-peer.mjs for why that independence matters.
