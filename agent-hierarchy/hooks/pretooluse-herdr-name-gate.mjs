/**
 * agent-hierarchy — PreToolUse gate on raw `herdr agent` Bash calls.
 *
 * `herdr agent start <name>`: Herdr refuses a name outside [a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,31} only when
 * `agent start` runs, and by then the caller has already split the pane it names — so a bad name
 * strands an empty pane, and the usual next move is to split another one. Denying the command
 * before it runs keeps the split pane usable: the deny says to reuse it with a valid name rather
 * than split a new one.
 *
 * Every Herdr CLI verb that writes input into a pane (`agent prompt|send-keys|attach`,
 * `pane send-text|send-keys|run`, `terminal attach|session control`), aimed at a non-Claude
 * hierarchy member by name or by its pane's id: denied. Such a member is briefed only through
 * `roster.mjs deliver`, which checks its screen first, and its prompts are answered only through
 * `roster.mjs answer`, with the user's choice. So every key that reaches it is a relay, never a
 * stray one. Reads (`get`, `read`, `wait`) stay allowed, and Claude members are untouched. No
 * config is read unless the command makes one of those calls.
 *
 * Fail-open: any error lets the call through, since Herdr still refuses a bad name itself.
