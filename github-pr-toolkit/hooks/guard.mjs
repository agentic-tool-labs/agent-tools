// github-pr-toolkit PreToolUse guard.
//
// Steers the plugin's delegation pattern: GitHub I/O belongs with the Haiku
// worker subagents (`github-worker` for general PR work, `critic-worker` for a
// code-critic review's writes), so raw API payloads stay out of the expensive
// model's context. The MAIN agent is not barred from GitHub: its first GitHub
// call in a session is stopped once and redirected to the worker, and after
// that its GitHub calls go through the user's normal permission flow.
//
// Mechanism: exit code 2 + a stderr message BLOCKS the tool call and feeds the
// message back to the model as feedback (per the Claude Code hooks reference);
// the once-per-session stop instead prints a PreToolUse deny as JSON and exits 0
// (see stopOnce).
//
// THREE TIERS, and the distinctions matter:
//
//   ONCE PER SESSION — always on, the same in or out of a review, because the
//   reason for delegating has nothing to do with a review being in progress.
//   The main agent's first call in a session to either transport below is
//   stopped (a deny with a calm message) and pointed at `github-worker`; every
//   later one, including the unchanged re-run, gets no output from this hook
//   and follows the user's own permission rules:
//     - any `mcp__github__*` / `mcp__plugin_github-pr-toolkit_github__*` tool
//     - the `gh` CLI, except local credential diagnostics (see the carve-out
//       below)
//   These two are deliberately symmetric: one rule and one one-shot cover both.
//   Holding the MCP door while leaving the `gh` window open just relocates the
//   same mistake, which is exactly what happened before `gh` was covered: with
//   no review armed, the orchestrator fell back to `gh pr create` and nothing
//   stopped it.
//
//   ARMED ONLY — for the DURATION of a code-critic review, in the SESSION that
//   initiated it:
//     - remote-mutating git: push / pull / commit / worktree
//   These stay lock-scoped on purpose. They are plain git against whatever
//   remote the repo has, not GitHub API access, and an always-on block would
//   stop ordinary committing in every session the plugin is installed in — far
//   past what this plugin has any business governing. During a review they ARE
//   blocked, because `critic-worker` owns the worktree/commit/push sequencing.
//
//   WORKER-SCOPED — always on, for THIS PLUGIN'S OWN subagents only
//   (`critic-worker`, `github-worker`, `code-reviewer-*`):
//     - destructive git (worktree remove/prune, reset --hard, clean, checkout,
//       branch -D, push --force, commit --amend, rebase, stash, gc, reflog …)
//     - recursive/forced `rm`, `rmdir`, `find -delete`
//     - `git worktree remove` is allowed ONLY for a path this plugin recorded
//       creating, and NEVER with `--force`.
//
//   WHY THIS TIER EXISTS — read before touching it. The two tiers above gate
//   WHO runs a command, not WHAT it does, and the subagent branch below exits
//   before either of them. So delegation LAUNDERED them: the orchestrator,
//   correctly blocked from `git worktree` by the armed tier, wrote
//   `git worktree remove --force <a worktree it did not create>` into a
//   critic-worker dispatch instead. The target held 8 unpushed commits belonging
//   to unrelated work. Nothing in the hook or the playbook would have stopped it;
//   a human reading the dispatch text did — and only because the dispatch had not
//   been sent yet.
//
//   Do NOT weaken this on the theory that the permission layer would have caught
//   it. Whether a worker's Bash call prompts anybody is version- and
//   session-dependent: `permissionMode: bypassPermissions` in the agent files is
//   NOT honored for plugin-shipped agents today (see the note further down), so
//   the call follows the normal flow — which for a non-interactive subagent
//   auto-denies, and interactively may surface a dialog. A later version honoring
//   the frontmatter would run it silently. "Sometimes something asks" is not an
//   invariant, and a dialog would show the COMMAND anyway, never the consequence
//   (8 unpushed commits) — which is the exact fact that was misjudged here.
//
//   Two invariants follow, and neither is expressible as "who runs git":
//     1. A review may destroy ONLY the worktree it created — the ledger, not a
//        path heuristic, is what distinguishes its own scratch checkout from
//        someone else's work sitting in the same directory.
//     2. `--force` is never delegated. Needing force MEANS "there is work here
//        I would destroy", which is the strongest available signal that a human
//        must decide. A failed plain removal is recoverable and reports back;
//        a forced one is not.
//   These workers run a small fixed playbook (fetch, worktree add, commit,
//   push, MCP comment posting) that touches none of the denied surfaces, so the
//   deny list costs the flows nothing. Err toward denial: a false block returns
//   an error the orchestrator must surface, which is the outcome that was
//   missing here.
//
// Scope — SESSION-NAMED lock files. The /code-critic command arms the guard at
// step 0 by touching `<cwd>/.git/code-critic-<session_id>.lock` (using
// $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID) and removes it on every exit path. The guard blocks
// only when the lock named after the hook input's OWN `session_id` exists —
// other sessions in the same repo are untouched, and two concurrent reviews
// each hold their own lock without clobbering each other. A freshness guard
// ignores a lock older than MAX_AGE_MS so a crashed run can't silently block a
// future session that reuses the ID.
//
// Fallback: a bare `<cwd>/.git/code-critic.lock` (armed when the session-id env
// var was unavailable) blocks ALL sessions — safe-but-blunt legacy behavior.
//
// What stays allowed to the main agent during its own review: read-only git
// (diff/log/status/show) AND `git fetch` — fetch publishes nothing and the
// orchestrator needs it to diff against a fresh `origin/<base>` (diff generation
// is deliberately NOT delegated to Haiku).
//
// ASSESSMENT GATE — a SECOND, narrower marker: `code-critic-<sid>.assessing`
// (armed alongside the lock at step 0, removed once the findings are presented
// and the user has chosen how to proceed at L6/G6). While it exists, the review
// is a STATIC pass over the diff: the main agent must not run tests, execute
// code, or shell out to diagnostic tooling to self-verify whether a finding is
// real — that verification is itself an ACTION and must be presented and
// approved first (the user's hard rule). Mechanism: while assessing, a Bash
// command that runs code (npm/pytest/make/node/python/./script …, see
// RUNNER_HEADS) is blocked ONCE with a nudge to present-and-ask; the identical
// command re-run goes through, so setup the review genuinely needs is not a
// dead end. Everything else passes. The marker is gone by the time the user has
// approved a way to proceed, so post-approval test runs never see the gate.
//
// One carve-out: the peer-agent transport is read-only FOR GATE PURPOSES.
// `hooks/msg.mjs new|list|index|route|global-scope` and `hooks/roster.mjs show|teams` write or
// read files under `.claude/hierarchy/` — the same class as the `touch` the
// orchestrator already uses for its markers — and `herdr agent
// prompt|get|read|wait` drive another pane and execute nothing in this repo.
// Without it, a peer picked as the reviewer is blocked at dispatch AND at reply
// collection, and the only workaround (lift the marker, send, re-arm) leaves
// the gate off during exactly the phase it exists for. Excluded on purpose:
// `herdr agent send-keys` (keystrokes into another agent's permission dialogs
// are laundering), `herdr pane close` (kills), `msg.mjs sweep` (deletes). See
// isPeerTransport for how narrow the match is.
