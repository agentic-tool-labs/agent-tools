 * task-gopher — SessionStart context injection.
 *
 * Injects the full delegation directive when the plugin is ON, so a fresh,
 * resumed, or post-compaction session starts already knowing to dispatch
 * tool-heavy work to task-gopher. MAIN SESSION ONLY: SessionStart never fires
 * for subagents — they receive the directive via the relay gate in
 * pretooluse-nudge.mjs instead. The directive's own tier gate means only
 * Sonnet-tier-or-higher agents act on it. Silent when OFF, and silent inside
 * either gopher.
