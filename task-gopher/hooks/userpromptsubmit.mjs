/**
 * task-gopher — UserPromptSubmit reminder.
 *
 * Keeps the delegation behavior alive turn-to-turn with a ONE-LINE reminder
 * (the full spec was injected at SessionStart — repeating it every turn would
 * itself waste the tokens this plugin exists to save). Also means a mid-session
 * `/task-gopher on` takes effect on the very next prompt. MAIN SESSION ONLY:
 * UserPromptSubmit never fires for subagents — they receive the directive via
 * the relay gate in pretooluse-nudge.mjs instead. The reminder's own tier gate
 * means only Sonnet-tier-or-higher agents act on it. Silent when OFF, and
 * silent inside either gopher.
