/**
 * comment-discipline — SessionStart context injection.
 *
 * Injects the authoring directive on startup, resume, clear, fork, and
 * post-compaction, so the rule survives the compaction that would otherwise
 * quietly drop it mid-session.
 *
 * MAIN SESSION ONLY — not a choice, a platform fact: SessionStart never fires
 * for subagents (a subagent is not a session). This hook therefore needs no
 * subagent gate: it simply never runs in one. That matters here more than for
 * the sibling plugins, because subagents write plenty of code — an Implementor
 * or a general-purpose agent is exactly who leaves `// NEW: added validation`
 * behind — so subagentstart.mjs covers them at spawn, with
 * posttooluse-inject.mjs as a backstop. See docs/subagent-directive-relay.md.
 *
 * Note the format asymmetry between the two: this event injects plain stdout as
 * context, SubagentStart does not. Both emit JSON here, which is valid for both.
 *
 * Three states:
 *   - unconfigured           → one-line setup nudge
 *   - configured + enabled   → the directive
 *   - configured + disabled  → silence (the user opted out; nudging them to
 *     configure something they deliberately turned off would be wrong)
